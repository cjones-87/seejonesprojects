# Portfolio Website - Designed & Constructed by CJ Jones

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end developer. It is an original concept created solely by me, and I have dedicated close to two years to its development. The website has been in production for nearly a year and a half, with regular updates being made on a weekly to monthly basis. Throughout its development, I have overhauled the UI multiple times to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
