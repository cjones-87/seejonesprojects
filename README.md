# Portfolio Website - Designed & Constructed by CJ Jones

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end developer. It is an original concept created solely by me, and I have dedicated close to two years to its development. The website has been in production for nearly a year and a half, with regular updates being made on a weekly to monthly basis. Throughout its development, I have overhauled the UI multiple times to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

          Fully responsive, portfolio website to showcase my UX/UI talents and
          personal projects. My website features a user-friendly platform that
          allows users to browse my personal works and reach out to schedule
          conversations/work. The technologies used to design and construct the
          website's front-end were carefully chosen to ensure a responsive,
          efficient, and intuitive UI/UX. I integrated JavaScript, React,
          PrimeReact, CSS3, and Three.js to create an interactive and visually
          appealing website that engages users.

          sound categories to choose from, allowing them to select different
          options within each category to facilitate studying and sleep habits.
          The MVP includes five related facts for each of the five senses and an
          additional random fact for each category. Hypnotiq was constructed
          using React Native and Expo for the front-end. Future goals include
          making the app more inclusive, adding more music genres, and allowing
          users to create, save, and share playlists with others, as well as
          comment on shared playlists.

          category preferences from a menu of options. Questions and answers are
          aggregated from an external API then formatted to meet the game's
          design. IYKYK's frontend consists of TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS3,
          and Three.js to create visually appealing 3D animations and rendering.
          IYKYK was created as an experiment to enhance my understanding of
          TypeScript, 3D animations, and rendering.

          emoji to increment a counter that displays the quantity of coffee they
          possess. They can use coffee to purchase coffee-producing devices such
          as percolators and espresso machines. The player accumulates coffee
          passively based on the number and type of coffee producers in stock.
          The game features a progression system where new producers are
          unlocked successively as they accumulate more coffee, and the price of
          each producer steadily increases.
