I used a combination of CSS3 and PrimeReact to illustrate and enhance the UI/UX, making it visually appealing, responsive, and interactive. While developing the website, I initially faced a significant challenge with routing internal pages to different routes. I had to conduct extensive research to understand the importance of staying up-to-date with current documentation and being explicit about versioning when searching for errors. This challenge helped me improve my researching and debugging skills, as well as my overall internet search efficacy.`,
