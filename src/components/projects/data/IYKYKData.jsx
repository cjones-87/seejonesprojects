    paragraph: `IYKYK is a multiple choice quiz game that I built using TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, Three.js, and deployed on Vercel. My Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a quiz game where users can choose their quiz category preferences from a menu of options. Each game has 10 questions with multiple choice answers. Questions and answers are aggregated from an external API then formatted to meet the game's design. My stretch goals include adding additional quiz topics and types, diversifying the categories, and implementing true/false questions. The navigation bar will be updated to include multi-nested menus and submenus.`,

    paragraph: `For the front-end of IYKYK, I constructed and designed it using TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, and Three.js. My goal was to enhance my understanding of 3D animations and rendering. I used a picture of smoke as a base and created, replicated, and animated particles to render these animated images as backgrounds to my landing and home pages.`,

    paragraph: `The main challenge I faced was learning the intricacies of TypeScript, having never used it professionally before. The syntactical sugar provided by TypeScript was extremely helpful in debugging. Another challenge was learning the differences in implementation between JavaScript and TypeScript. However, I had fun learning these new technologies.`,

I enjoyed learning the nuances of applying my existing knowledge of JavaScript and applying that knowledge to my implementation of TypeScript. IYKYK was created as an experiment to enhance my understanding of Typescript, 3D animations, and rendering.`,
