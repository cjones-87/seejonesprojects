    paragraph: `In my central role directing the development of Computer Love, a mobile application for individuals in the tech industry seeking dating or networking opportunities, my primary contribution involved architecting the initial back-end and front-end as distinct repositories. Simultaneously, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing the intricate logic for user matching and swiping. This required extensive research to comprehend the necessity of approaching a user’s swipe as rotational interpolation rather than a simplistic directional movement. The user-matching logic was crafted to align with users’ individual dating or networking preferences, ensuring that connections made through Computer Love catered to the unique challenges and demands of the tech industry.`,
