The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allowed users and administrators to purchase books with or without a registered account. This site made use of a persistent cart feature and users could modify only their own purchase information. I also implemented administrative access to user information and order history.`,

Administrators had complete access to personal accounts, as well as the accounts of all other users, while users could only access their own personal accounts. Another challenge was ensuring that the site was responsive and easy to use across a variety of devices.`,
